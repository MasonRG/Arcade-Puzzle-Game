## Details

This project was created in order to gain experience with C++ programming and to learn how to use the Entity Component System found in the EnTT library. The project was created for educational purposes and so the code and structure might leave a bit to be desired. Being new to C++, I hope I didn't break too many conventions or do anything too unusual.

In any case, I hope this project might serve as a useful resource to others who are perhaps new to C++ and EnTT, as I was when creating it.

### External Libraries

##### SDL2
[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) is used for rendering as well as input and event handling.

##### SDL2_image
[SDL2 Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) is used for reading image files such as jpg or png.

##### SDL2_ttf
[SDL2 TTF](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/index.html) is used for reading ttf files and generating textures from text.

##### EnTT
[EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) provides an Enitity Component System (ECS) that is the primary driver of gameplay and is the focus of the project.
